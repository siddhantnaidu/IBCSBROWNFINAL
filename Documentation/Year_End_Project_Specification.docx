Year end collaborative project

PROJECT PROBLEM STATEMENT
Discuss the problem or opportunity that is scheduled for resolution.
Our opportunity is to improve how students and others learn, review and retain information. Typical flashcard apps require manual input which is time consuming and limits how much time you can spend on studying. Our project uses AI to automatically generate flashcards to make studying more time efficient
CONCISE DESIGN OVERVIEW
After researching potential technologies you will identify the components of your solution. Develop a prototype or model of what your final solution would look like, providing abstract information about the individual components.
Users will enter a topic, question or paste study material and the program will return flashcards. It will prompt user for inputs and a user interface where they can view their flashcards. It will automatically store flashcards and save them for later. User can access and organize them as well. Display flash cards and allow them to edit
SCOPE STATEMENT
SMART goals or objectives would include deliverables. Clarify as necessary what the scope includes and does not include.
Our goal is to create an application that allows users to input educational content and receive auto generated flash cards. The scope includes generating flashcards from user input

TIMELINE
Draw a timeline, including milestones to serve as the basis for a work breakdown structure (WBS) and appropriate Gantt or PERT charts. For this class, you can refer to the Work Breakdown Excel Sheet. This can be a table with anticipated tasks listed for each school day of the project. You will submit completed chart(or Record of Tasks) along with your final deliverables.
Our goal is to establish a prototype and create a demo of our product by 5/26.  and test our protype by 5/27. Then fix and reconfigure based on feedback and testing. Then fix and work on the program until finally our protype will be finished by 6/5. Then test and fix bugs until our demo presentation
TEST PLAN
Describe how you will test your solution.  The plan should include testing the whole solution and testing individual components of the solution.  Include details such as if you will automate testing or you will manually test with positive and negative test cases.
The following test cases will be used
 Users can enter a topic or text and receive relevant flashcards

 Flashcards contain concise, accurate, question-answer pairs

Users can edit flashcards after generation

 Flashcards can be saved and reloaded correctly

 Application handles invalid input or API errors gracefully


RISKS AND CONTINGENCY PLANS
List known and potential risks by estimated probability, with mitigation plans.
A risk could be inaccurate or irrelevant flashcards and or difficulty saving flashcards. we will add filters and prompt tuning to improve quality and add some sort of database for the flashcards to be stored in
